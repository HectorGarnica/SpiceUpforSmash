# SpiceUpforSmash
Simply select how many people are playing, and press GO!  
   
This app will give players the chance to get a slight advantage or disadvantage when playing Smash with their friends.  

## Possible quirks or powerups include  
- Make a player play with different control layout  
- Choose a players character for them  
- get a cpu of random difficulty to help you fight (Decided by app)  
- turn on one item of choice  
- everyone chooses random  
- get first hit at start of match  
- set a players starting damage to 30 percent  
- choose any map  

## Motivation
For me and my buddies, playing Smash Brothers with items turned on was no fun for us, and sometimes playing with no items at all got too serious.  

I created this for me and my friends. It was lots of fun and I'm happy they enjoyed it too.
